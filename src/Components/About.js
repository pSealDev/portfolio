                    Hi, my name is Priscilla Seal. I'm a Computer Science B.S. graduate, with a B.A. in Psychology to boot. Before this, I was a
                    mostly self-taught web developer. Now I work in the software engineering space. Check out my projects.

                <br />
                <div>
                    I love working with JavaScript and the JS ecosystem. This is my focus at the moment.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Aside from coding, I also am pretty interested generally in media and the arts. I draw, write, love working with the Adobe Suite,
                    and combine all of this with my love for code and tech.
